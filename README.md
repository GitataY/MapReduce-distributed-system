# MapReduce-distributed-system
The system can be deployed on a cluster of machines and configured to use a specific number of worker nodes, which will be responsible for processing data in parallel. The master node can be accessed through a well-defined API, which can be implemented as a long-running HTTP server or passed parameters through configuration files.

When a user submits a MapReduce job through the API, the master node partitions the input data and assigns tasks to worker nodes. The worker nodes process the data and send the results back to the master node, which combines them and returns the final output to the user.

The system also handles failures and ensures fault-tolerance by detecting when a worker node fails and reassigning its tasks to other worker nodes. The system also supports dynamic membership, allowing new worker nodes to join the system or existing nodes to leave without disrupting the processing of tasks.

Overall, the system provides a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for processing large-scale data using the MapReduce paradigm.
